# Define the path to the Teams cache directory

# Check if the cache directory exists
if (Test-Path $teamsCachePath -PathType Container) {
    # Remove all files and subdirectories from the cache directory
    Remove-Item -Path $teamsCachePath\* -Recurse -Force

    Write-Host "Microsoft Teams cache cleared successfully."
